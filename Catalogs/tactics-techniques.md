## Introduction

Cyber warfare tactics encompass a wide range of strategies used to infiltrate, disrupt, and compromise target systems. By understanding the tactics and techniques employed by threat actors, we can better defend against cyber attacks and develop effective incident response plans.

## Tactics

### Phishing

- Description: Deceptive emails or messages sent to trick users into divulging sensitive information or executing malicious code.
- Purpose: Gain unauthorized access, steal credentials, or distribute malware.
- Countermeasures: User education, email filtering, and multi-factor authentication.

### Malware Distribution

- Description: Distribution of malicious software to infect systems and gain control.
- Purpose: Establish backdoors, steal data, or conduct reconnaissance.
- Countermeasures: Antivirus software, software updates, and network segmentation.

### Denial of Service (DoS)

- Description: Overwhelming a system or network to disrupt normal operations and deny service to users.
- Purpose: Cause service outages, disrupt operations, or divert attention.
- Countermeasures: DDoS protection, load balancing, and traffic filtering.

## Techniques

### Spear Phishing

- Description: Targeted phishing attacks tailored to specific individuals or organizations.
- Characteristics: Personalized content, spoofed sender, and relevant context.
- Countermeasures: User training, email authentication, and vigilant monitoring.

### Exploit Kits

- Description: Bundles of software vulnerabilities and exploits to target known vulnerabilities.
- Purpose: Deliver malware, gain control, and infect vulnerable systems.
- Countermeasures: Patch management, vulnerability scanning, and intrusion detection.

### Botnets

- Description: Networks of compromised devices controlled by a central entity (botmaster).
- Purpose: Perform coordinated attacks, distribute malware, and conduct DDoS attacks.
- Countermeasures: Botnet detection, malware removal, and network monitoring.
